//DOM (document object model)
// dom allows us to manipulate edit our webpage content in general HTML contents.
//each content in HTML and CSS is formed in tree so every parent has it's own node 
//So all node become object 
//changes in dom reflect to change in code of html and css

    // console.dir(document) // this will show all method and properties of document
    // so changes that we make are on window 

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------

//if we have to change in html and css using js then there is two steps:
//1) select
//2) changes /manipulate

console.dir(document.all[5].innerText ='BatMan')
